This is a vehicle rental application that generates an invoice to the customer. First i made the interfaces for the different vehicles, then implemented the methods in the vehicle methods and added additional fields and constructors. After that i created service classes that handle the business logic nad print the invoices. Then i implented everything inside the main class while also gathering information from the customer and finally added validations for the information that is being passed by the customer so everything makes sense.
